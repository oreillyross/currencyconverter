# Currency converter project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is intended as a sort of playground to experiment converting the project to typescript, using testing, especially the [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/) library.

## Branches

The project has a number of branches which illustrate the different transformations that happened on the vanilla javascript react app.

- typescript - the conversion to fully typed code
- testing - the addition of rock steady testing according to [KCD's testing trophy model](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests)
- pwa - the addition of code to turn app into a progressive web app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### Deployment

The app can be deployed on a variety of platforms, notably Vercel, Digitial Ocean, Netlify, AWS.

### Future developments

There is also scope to grow the project incorporating serverless tech.
